Database Guillotine Changelog
For version 1.3+

v1.3
  - Added tool parameter validation script.
  - Added option to use existing blank GDB.
  - Added option to use full extent of data instead of AOI.
  - Attempted to implement option to use custom query to extract data.
  - Attempted to implement checkbox list to choose specific feature classes to include or 
    exclude in extraction.
  - Added explosion of multipart features after splitting along AOI/extent boundaries. Features 
    maintain original attribution and NULL attributes are populated with default values.

v1.4
  - Updated formatting of task summary.
  - Improvements to option to use custom query to extract data.
  - Improvements to checkbox list to choose specific feature classes to include or exclude in 
    extraction.

v1.5
  - Sanitize feature class names when connected to SDE. Removes "sde_name.sde." prefix.
  - Added parameter for custom name of new output GDB.
  - Added parameter for folder location of new output GDB rather than creating it in the same 
    parent folder as the source.
  - Reintroduced feature to check for a matching schema between source and existing blank target 
    GDB. Warns user that the output GDB provided doesn't match the schema of the source GDB. 
    Progress will continue with feature classes that match the schema. A list of feature classes 
    that were not copied due to schema mismatch will be printed at end of processing.
  - Updated logic for checking crossing and within spatial relations of features and AOI/extent.
  - Refactored main Guillotine logic into function and externalized the source Walk.
  - Reworked logic to create extent polygon for Full Extent option using in_memory space and 
    the dataset environment properties.

v1.6
  - Improvements to custom SQL query option.
  - Added Field Name Reference field to populate Field Names in SQL query dialogue box.
  - Added hidden middleman query to correctly link the source dataset to the Field Name 
    Reference and custom SQL query parameters for proper validation.
  - Improvements to checkbox list to choose specific feature classes to include or exclude in 
    extraction.
  - Updated path mapping to feature classes when connected to SDE.
  - Updated formatting of task summary.

v1.7
  - Updated and improved tool validation script to sanitize inputs and provide error and warning 
    messages within the tool dialogue window.
  - Added Tool Help section for each parameter.
  - Created full tool documentation.

v1.8
  - Fixed lingering og_oid field for split multipart feature classes.
  - Fixed validation bug. If the custom SQL query option was checked, the default query 
    parameter value deleted, and the custom SQL query option then unchecked, it would lock the 
    tool until the option was rechecked and any value assigned to the parameter. It could then 
    be deactivated again and the tool could continue without needed a valid query.
  - Sorted fc_list that is applied to parameter 10 "Field Name Reference".
  - Added option to download all additional tables and files in the GDB in addition to the 
    dataset. Used for final delivery copies.
  - Fixed task_summary bug with formatted spacing for query line.
